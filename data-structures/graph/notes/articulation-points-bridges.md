# 🌉 **Articulation Points & Bridges - Complete Guide**

## 📚 **What are Articulation Points (Cut Vertices)?**

### **Definition:**
An **articulation point** (or cut vertex) is a vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

### **Visual Example:**
```
Original Graph (1 component):
    A ─── B ─── C
    │     │     │
    D ─── E ─── F

Remove B (articulation point):
    A     │     C
    │     │     │
    D ─── E ─── F

Result: Graph splits into 2 components: {A,D} and {C,E,F}
```

**Key Insight**: Articulation points are critical vertices - removing them disconnects the graph.

## 🌉 **What are Bridges (Cut Edges)?**

### **Definition:**
A **bridge** (or cut edge) is an edge whose removal increases the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

### **Correct Example 1: Simple Linear Chain**
```
Original Graph (1 component):
A ─── B ─── C ─── D

Remove edge B-C (bridge):
A ─── B     C ─── D

Result: Graph splits into 2 components: {A,B} and {C,D}
```

### **Correct Example 2: Bridge in Tree Structure**
```
Original Graph (1 component):
    A ─── B ─── C
          │     
          D     
          │
          E

Remove edge B-D (bridge):
    A ─── B ─── C
              
          D     
          │
          E

Result: Graph splits into 2 components: {A,B,C} and {D,E}
```

### **Non-Bridge Example (Cycle):**
```
Original Graph:
    A ─── B
    │     │
    D ─── C

Remove any edge (e.g., A-B):
          B
          │
    D ─── C

Result: Still 1 component {A,B,C,D} - NO BRIDGE!
Alternative paths exist: A can reach B via A→D→C→B
```

**Key Insight**: Bridges are critical edges - removing them disconnects the graph.

## 🚀 **Tarjan's Algorithm - The Gold Standard**

### **Core Insight:**
Use DFS with **discovery times** and **low-link values** to identify critical elements in a single O(V+E) pass.

### **Key Concepts:**

#### **Discovery Time (`disc[u]`):**
The timestamp when vertex `u` is first visited during DFS traversal.

#### **Low-Link Value (`low[u]`):**
The lowest discovery time reachable from `u` using back edges (not going through parent).

#### **Parent Tracking:**
Keep track of DFS tree structure to distinguish tree edges from back edges.

---

## 🧠 **Algorithm Rules**

### **For Articulation Points:**

#### **Rule 1 - Root Node:**
```
Root is articulation point ⟺ Root has more than 1 child in DFS tree
```

#### **Rule 2 - Non-Root Node:**
```
Node u is articulation point ⟺ ∃ child v such that low[v] ≥ disc[u]
```
**Meaning**: No back edge from subtree of `v` can reach an ancestor of `u`.

### **For Bridges:**

#### **Bridge Rule:**
```
Edge (u,v) is a bridge ⟺ low[v] > disc[u]
```
**Meaning**: No back edge from subtree of `v` can reach `u` or any ancestor of `u`.

## 📝 **Complete Walkthrough Example**

### **Sample Graph:**
```
    0 ─── 1 ─── 2
    │     │     │
    3 ─── 4 ─── 5
          │
          6

Edges: 0-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-4, 4-1, 4-6, 4-3, 3-0
```

### **DFS Traversal (starting from 0):**

#### **Step-by-Step Execution:**

```
Initialize: time = 0

Visit 0: disc[0] = 0, low[0] = 0, parent[0] = -1, time = 1
├─ Visit 1: disc[1] = 1, low[1] = 1, parent[1] = 0, time = 2
   ├─ Visit 2: disc[2] = 2, low[2] = 2, parent[2] = 1, time = 3
      ├─ Visit 5: disc[5] = 3, low[5] = 3, parent[5] = 2, time = 4
         ├─ Visit 4: disc[4] = 4, low[4] = 4, parent[4] = 5, time = 5
            ├─ Back edge 4-1: low[4] = min(4, disc[1]) = min(4, 1) = 1
            ├─ Visit 6: disc[6] = 5, low[6] = 5, parent[6] = 4, time = 6
            │  └─ Backtrack: low[4] = min(1, 5) = 1
            ├─ Visit 3: disc[3] = 6, low[3] = 6, parent[3] = 4, time = 7
               ├─ Back edge 3-0: low[3] = min(6, disc[0]) = min(6, 0) = 0
               └─ Backtrack: low[4] = min(1, 0) = 0
         └─ Backtrack: low[5] = min(3, 0) = 0
      └─ Backtrack: low[2] = min(2, 0) = 0
   └─ Backtrack: low[1] = min(1, 0) = 0
└─ Backtrack: low[0] = min(0, 0) = 0
```

#### **Final Values:**
```
Node:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6
disc:    0  1  2  6  4  3  5
low:     0  0  0  0  0  0  5
parent: -1  0  1  4  5  2  4
```

### **Finding Articulation Points:**

#### **Check Root (node 0):**
```
Children of 0 in DFS tree: {1}
Count = 1 ≤ 1 → NOT an articulation point
```

#### **Check Non-Root Nodes:**
```
Node 1: low[2] ≥ disc[1]? → 0 ≥ 1 → False
Node 2: low[5] ≥ disc[2]? → 0 ≥ 2 → False
Node 3: (leaf node, no children to check)
Node 4: 
  - Child 6: low[6] ≥ disc[4]? → 5 ≥ 4 → True ✓
  - Child 3: low[3] ≥ disc[4]? → 0 ≥ 4 → False
  Since at least one child satisfies condition → ARTICULATION POINT
Node 5: low[4] ≥ disc[5]? → 0 ≥ 3 → False
Node 6: (leaf node, no children to check)
```

**Result: Articulation Points = {4}**

### **Finding Bridges:**

#### **Check All Tree Edges:**
```
Edge 0-1: low[1] > disc[0]? → 0 > 0 → False
Edge 1-2: low[2] > disc[1]? → 0 > 1 → False
Edge 2-5: low[5] > disc[2]? → 0 > 2 → False
Edge 5-4: low[4] > disc[5]? → 0 > 3 → False
Edge 4-6: low[6] > disc[4]? → 5 > 4 → True ✓
Edge 4-3: low[3] > disc[4]? → 0 > 4 → False
```

**Result: Bridges = {(4,6)}**

## ⚡ **Algorithm Implementation Structure**

### **High-Level Pseudocode:**
```python
def tarjan_articulation_bridges(graph):
    n = len(graph.nodes)
    visited = [False] * n
    disc = [-1] * n          # Discovery times
    low = [-1] * n           # Low-link values
    parent = [-1] * n        # Parent in DFS tree
    
    articulation_points = set()
    bridges = []
    time = [0]               # Mutable counter
    
    # Handle disconnected components
    for node in range(n):
        if not visited[node]:
            tarjan_dfs(node, visited, disc, low, parent, 
                      articulation_points, bridges, time, graph)
    
    return articulation_points, bridges

def tarjan_dfs(u, visited, disc, low, parent, ap_set, bridges, time, graph):
    children = 0
    visited[u] = True
    disc[u] = low[u] = time[0]
    time[0] += 1
    
    for v in graph.get_neighbors(u):
        if not visited[v]:                    # Tree edge
            children += 1
            parent[v] = u
            tarjan_dfs(v, visited, disc, low, parent, ap_set, bridges, time, graph)
            
            # Update low-link value
            low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])
            
            # Check articulation point conditions
            if parent[u] == -1 and children > 1:      # Root with >1 children
                ap_set.add(u)
            if parent[u] != -1 and low[v] >= disc[u]: # Non-root condition
                ap_set.add(u)
            
            # Check bridge condition
            if low[v] > disc[u]:
                bridges.append((u, v))
                
        elif v != parent[u]:                  # Back edge (not to parent)
            low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])
```

## 🎯 **Key Implementation Details**

### **Time Complexity: O(V + E)**
- Single DFS traversal visits each vertex once
- Each edge examined exactly twice (once from each endpoint)
- All operations per vertex/edge are constant time

### **Space Complexity: O(V)**
- Arrays for discovery times, low values, parents: O(V)
- Recursion stack depth: O(V) in worst case
- Result storage: O(V) for articulation points + O(E) for bridges

### **Critical Implementation Points:**

#### **1. Proper Edge Classification:**
```python
if not visited[v]:           # Tree edge - explore
elif v != parent[u]:         # Back edge - update low value
# else: ignore (edge to parent in undirected graph)
```

#### **2. Low-Link Value Updates:**
```python
# After exploring tree edge child
low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

# On discovering back edge  
low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])  # Use disc[v], not low[v]!
```

#### **3. Root Node Special Handling:**
```python
if parent[u] == -1:  # Root node
    if children > 1:
        ap_set.add(u)
```

## 🔧 **Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases**

### **Edge Cases to Test:**

#### **1. Single Node Graph:**
```
Graph: A
Articulation Points: {} (none)
Bridges: {} (none)
```

#### **2. Two Node Graph:**
```
Graph: A ─── B
Articulation Points: {} (removing either leaves 1 component)
Bridges: {(A,B)} (removing edge creates 2 components)
```

#### **3. Simple Cycle:**
```
Graph: A ─── B ─── C ─── A
Articulation Points: {} (removing any vertex leaves connected graph)
Bridges: {} (removing any edge leaves connected graph)
```

#### **4. Complete Tree:**
```
Graph:     A
          ╱ ╲
         B   C
        ╱ ╲
       D   E

Articulation Points: {A, B} (internal nodes)
Bridges: {(A,B), (A,C), (B,D), (B,E)} (all edges in tree)
```

#### **5. Disconnected Graph:**
```
Graph: A ─── B    C ─── D
Articulation Points: {} (each component has no articulation points)
Bridges: {(A,B), (C,D)} (bridges within each component)
```

### **Implementation Traps:**

#### **1. Back Edge to Parent:**
```python
# WRONG: This would incorrectly update low value
for v in neighbors[u]:
    if visited[v]:
        low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])

# CORRECT: Exclude parent
for v in neighbors[u]:
    if visited[v] and v != parent[u]:  # Back edge, not to parent
        low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])
```

#### **2. Using low[v] instead of disc[v] for back edges:**
```python
# WRONG: Back edge should use discovery time
low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])

# CORRECT: Back edge uses discovery time
low[u] = min(low[u], disc[v])
```

#### **3. Forgetting Root Node Special Case:**
```python
# WRONG: Same condition for all nodes
if low[v] >= disc[u]:
    ap_set.add(u)

# CORRECT: Different conditions for root vs non-root
if parent[u] == -1 and children > 1:
    ap_set.add(u)
elif parent[u] != -1 and low[v] >= disc[u]:
    ap_set.add(u)
```
