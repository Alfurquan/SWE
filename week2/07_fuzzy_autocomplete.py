Week 2 - Problem 7: Advanced Autocomplete (Fuzzy Search)
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 60 minutes | Google L5 String Algorithms

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Build autocomplete system with fuzzy matching and ranking

OPERATIONS:
- addWord(word, frequency): Add word with frequency weight
- search(prefix, limit): Get top suggestions for prefix
- fuzzySearch(query, max_distance): Find words within edit distance
- updateFrequency(word, delta): Update word frequency
- getTopWords(count): Get most frequent words

REQUIREMENTS:
- Support exact prefix matching
- Fuzzy matching with edit distance (Levenshtein)
- Frequency-based ranking
- Handle typos and misspellings
- Efficient for large dictionaries

ALGORITHM:
Trie + Edit distance + Frequency ranking

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Search engines, mobile keyboards, IDE code completion, e-commerce search

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to handle multiple languages?
- Real-time learning from user behavior?
- Personalized suggestions?
- Distributed autocomplete across data centers?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
autocomplete = FuzzyAutocomplete()
autocomplete.addWord("apple", frequency=100)
autocomplete.addWord("application", frequency=50)
suggestions = autocomplete.search("app", limit=5)
fuzzy = autocomplete.fuzzySearch("aple", max_distance=1)
