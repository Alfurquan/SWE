Week 2 - Problem 5: Cache with Optimal Replacement (Belady's Algorithm)
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 50 minutes | Google L5 Dynamic Programming

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Implement optimal cache replacement algorithm (Belady's Algorithm)

OPERATIONS:
- process(access_sequence): Process sequence of page accesses
- getPageFaults(): Return total page faults
- getCacheState(): Return current cache contents
- simulate(sequence, cache_size): Simulate with different cache sizes

REQUIREMENTS:
- Implement theoretical optimal algorithm (knows future)
- Compare with FIFO, LRU performance
- Handle variable cache sizes
- Detailed statistics tracking

ALGORITHM:
Look-ahead algorithm - evict page that will be accessed furthest in future

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Operating system page replacement, cache performance analysis, theoretical benchmarks

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- Practical approximations to optimal?
- Real-time implementation challenges?
- Integration with prediction algorithms?
- Multi-level cache hierarchies?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
optimal_cache = OptimalCache(cache_size=3)
sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
faults = optimal_cache.process(sequence)
print(f"Page faults: {faults}")
