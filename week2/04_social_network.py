Week 2 - Problem 4: Social Network (Friend Recommendations)
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 60 minutes | Google L5 Graph Applications

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design a social network system with friend recommendation algorithm

OPERATIONS:
- addUser(user_id): Add new user
- addFriendship(user1, user2): Create friendship
- getFriends(user_id): Get direct friends
- suggestFriends(user_id, count): Recommend friends
- getConnectionDegree(user1, user2): Find degrees of separation
- findInfluencers(): Find most connected users

REQUIREMENTS:
- Efficient friend recommendations (mutual friends algorithm)
- Handle large user bases (millions of users)
- Real-time updates to recommendations
- Privacy considerations

ALGORITHM:
Graph traversal, mutual friends calculation, PageRank-style influence

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Facebook, LinkedIn, social media platforms, professional networks

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to scale to billions of users?
- Real-time vs batch recommendation updates?
- Privacy and data protection?
- Machine learning integration?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
social = SocialNetwork()
social.addUser("alice")
social.addUser("bob")
social.addFriendship("alice", "bob")
suggestions = social.suggestFriends("alice", 5)
degree = social.getConnectionDegree("alice", "charlie")
