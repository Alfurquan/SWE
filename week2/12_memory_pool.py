Week 2 - Problem 12: Memory Pool Allocator
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 55 minutes | Google L5 Memory Management

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design a memory pool allocator for efficient memory management

OPERATIONS:
- allocate(size): Allocate memory block of given size
- deallocate(pointer): Free previously allocated memory
- defragment(): Compact memory to reduce fragmentation
- getStats(): Get allocation statistics
- resize(new_size): Resize memory pool

REQUIREMENTS:
- Handle different block sizes efficiently
- Minimize fragmentation
- Fast allocation/deallocation (O(1) when possible)
- Memory coalescing for adjacent free blocks

ALGORITHM:
Free list management, buddy system, or slab allocation

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Operating systems, garbage collectors, high-performance applications

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- Thread safety for concurrent allocation?
- Integration with garbage collection?
- NUMA awareness?
- Memory protection and bounds checking?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
pool = MemoryPool(total_size=1024)
ptr1 = pool.allocate(64)
ptr2 = pool.allocate(128)
pool.deallocate(ptr1)
pool.defragment()
stats = pool.getStats()
