Week 2 - Problem 9: Sliding Window Maximum
Difficulty: Medium-Hard | Time Limit: 35 minutes | Google L5 Queue Applications

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Find maximum element in all sliding windows of size k

OPERATIONS:
- processArray(nums, k): Process array with window size k
- getMaxInWindow(window): Get maximum in current window
- addElement(num): Add element to sliding window
- removeElement(): Remove oldest element from window

REQUIREMENTS:
- O(n) time complexity for processing entire array
- Handle duplicate maximum values
- Support dynamic window size changes
- Memory efficient implementation

ALGORITHM:
Deque-based approach with monotonic property

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Time series analysis, stock price monitoring, sensor data processing

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to handle very large datasets?
- Parallel processing of windows?
- Real-time streaming data?
- Multiple window sizes simultaneously?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
window_max = SlidingWindowMax()
nums = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
result = window_max.processArray(nums, k=3)
print(result)  # [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
