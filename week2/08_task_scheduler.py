Week 2 - Problem 8: Task Scheduler with Priorities
Difficulty: Medium-Hard | Time Limit: 50 minutes | Google L5 Heap Applications

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design a task scheduler with priority queues and deadlines

OPERATIONS:
- addTask(task_id, priority, deadline, duration): Add task
- executeNext(): Execute highest priority task
- postponeTask(task_id, new_deadline): Reschedule task
- getQueueStatus(): Get current queue state
- simulate(time_units): Simulate scheduler execution

REQUIREMENTS:
- Priority-based scheduling (higher priority first)
- Deadline awareness (urgent tasks first)
- Handle task preemption
- Track completion times and missed deadlines

ALGORITHM:
Multiple priority queues, heap-based scheduling

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Operating system schedulers, job queues, real-time systems

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to handle starvation?
- Real-time scheduling constraints?
- Multi-core scheduling?
- Dynamic priority adjustment?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
scheduler = TaskScheduler()
scheduler.addTask("task1", priority=5, deadline=10, duration=3)
scheduler.addTask("task2", priority=10, deadline=15, duration=2)
next_task = scheduler.executeNext()
status = scheduler.getQueueStatus()
