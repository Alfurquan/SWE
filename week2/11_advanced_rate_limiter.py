Week 2 - Problem 11: Rate Limiter with Multiple Policies
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 55 minutes | Google L5 Advanced Rate Limiting

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Implement advanced rate limiter supporting multiple algorithms

OPERATIONS:
- addRule(user_id, algorithm, limit, window): Configure rate limit
- isAllowed(user_id, timestamp): Check if request allowed
- getAlgorithmStats(algorithm): Get performance statistics
- updateRule(user_id, new_limit): Dynamically update limits

REQUIREMENTS:
- Support Fixed Window, Sliding Window, Token Bucket, Leaky Bucket
- Multiple simultaneous rules per user
- Efficient memory cleanup
- Detailed analytics

ALGORITHMS:
Multiple rate limiting algorithms with unified interface

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
API gateways, DDoS protection, resource management, SLA enforcement

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- Distributed rate limiting across servers?
- Machine learning for dynamic limits?
- Integration with payment/subscription systems?
- Performance under extreme load?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
limiter = AdvancedRateLimiter()
limiter.addRule("user1", "token_bucket", limit=100, window=60)
limiter.addRule("user1", "sliding_window", limit=1000, window=3600)
allowed = limiter.isAllowed("user1", timestamp)
