Week 2 - Problem 10: Multi-Level Cache System
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 60 minutes | Google L5 System Integration

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design a multi-level cache hierarchy (L1, L2, L3)

OPERATIONS:
- get(key): Retrieve from appropriate cache level
- put(key, value): Store with level promotion
- evict(level): Manual eviction from specific level
- getStats(): Get hit/miss ratios per level
- configure(level, policy): Set eviction policy per level

REQUIREMENTS:
- Different eviction policies per level (LRU, FIFO, LFU)
- Automatic promotion/demotion between levels
- Configurable cache sizes
- Comprehensive statistics tracking

ALGORITHM:
Hierarchical cache management with intelligent promotion

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
CPU cache hierarchies, distributed caching systems, CDN architectures

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to optimize for different access patterns?
- Write-through vs write-back policies?
- Cache coherence in distributed systems?
- Machine learning for cache optimization?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
cache = MultiLevelCache(
    l1_size=10, l1_policy="LRU",
    l2_size=100, l2_policy="LFU",
    l3_size=1000, l3_policy="FIFO"
)
cache.put("key1", "value1")
value = cache.get("key1")
stats = cache.getStats()
