# Core Data Structures

## 1. Hash Tables/Hash Maps

### What is it?
Imagine you have a huge library with millions of books. Instead of searching through every shelf, you have a magical catalog system where you can instantly find any book by its title. That's essentially what a hash table does!

A hash table stores key-value pairs and uses a mathematical function (hash function) to determine where to store each piece of data.

### How it works (Simple Explanation):
```
Step 1: You want to store ("john_doe", "John's Profile Data")
Step 2: Hash function converts "john_doe" → 42 (array index)
Step 3: Store the data at position 42 in the array
Step 4: To retrieve, hash "john_doe" → 42 → get data instantly!
```

### Real-World Analogy:
Think of a post office with numbered P.O. boxes. The postal worker doesn't search through every box - they use the box number (hash) to go directly to the right location.

### When to Use Hash Tables:
1. **Caching**: Store frequently accessed data
2. **User Sessions**: Keep track of logged-in users
3. **Database Indexing**: Quick lookups by key
4. **Load Balancing**: Decide which server handles a request

### Why Use Hash Tables:
- **Lightning Fast**: O(1) average lookup time
- **Scalable**: Performance doesn't degrade with size
- **Flexible**: Can store any type of data

### System Design Examples:

#### Example 1: User Session Management
```
Problem: Netflix needs to track 200 million active users
Solution: Hash table where key=session_id, value=user_data

user_sessions = {
    "abc123": {"user_id": 12345, "subscription": "premium", "last_active": "2025-10-09"},
    "def456": {"user_id": 67890, "subscription": "basic", "last_active": "2025-10-09"}
}

When user makes request with session_id "abc123":
1. Hash "abc123" → get array position instantly
2. Retrieve user data in O(1) time
3. Serve personalized content
```

#### Example 2: Database Sharding
```
Problem: Twitter has billions of tweets, too many for one database
Solution: Use hash table to distribute tweets across multiple databases

def get_database_shard(tweet_id):
    shard_number = hash(tweet_id) % number_of_databases
    return database_servers[shard_number]

tweet_12345 → hash(12345) % 10 = 5 → Database Server 5
tweet_67890 → hash(67890) % 10 = 3 → Database Server 3
```

### Common Pitfalls:
- **Hash Collisions**: Multiple keys hash to same position (use chaining or open addressing)
- **Poor Hash Function**: Can cause uneven distribution
- **Memory Usage**: Can use more memory than needed

## 2. Trees

### What are Trees?
Think of your family tree or a company's organizational chart. Trees are hierarchical data structures where elements (nodes) are connected in a parent-child relationship.

### Types of Trees for System Design:

## 2.1 B-Trees and B+ Trees

### What is it?
Imagine organizing a massive library. Instead of one giant alphabetical list, you create a smart filing system:
- Top level: A-F, G-M, N-S, T-Z
- Second level: Under A-F, you have A-B, C-D, E-F
- And so on...

This is exactly how B-Trees work in databases!

### When to Use B-Trees:
1. **Database Indexing**: MySQL, PostgreSQL use B+ trees for indexes
2. **File Systems**: File allocation tables
3. **Search Operations**: When you need sorted, range-based queries

### Why B-Trees are Perfect for Databases:
- **Balanced**: Always maintains optimal height
- **Range Queries**: Find all users aged 25-35 efficiently
- **Disk-Friendly**: Designed for storage systems

### Real Example - Database Index:
```
Problem: Find all users with age between 25-30 in a 10 million user database

Without B-Tree: 
- Scan all 10 million records → Very slow!

With B-Tree Index on Age:
Level 1: [1-20] [21-40] [41-60] [61-80]
Level 2: Under [21-40]: [21-25] [26-30] [31-35] [36-40]
Level 3: Under [26-30]: [26] [27] [28] [29] [30]

Query path: Root → [21-40] → [26-30] → Get all records
Result: Only 3-4 disk reads instead of millions!
```

## 2.2 LSM Trees (Log-Structured Merge Trees)

### What is it?
Imagine you're a journalist who needs to write stories very quickly. Instead of perfectly organizing every story immediately, you:
1. Write new stories quickly in your notebook (in-memory)
2. Periodically organize and file them properly (disk storage)
3. When searching, check recent notebook first, then filed stories

This is how LSM Trees handle writes!

### When to Use LSM Trees:
1. **Write-Heavy Applications**: Social media posts, log data, IoT sensors
2. **Time-Series Data**: Metrics, monitoring data
3. **Big Data Systems**: Cassandra, LevelDB, RocksDB

### Why LSM Trees for Write-Heavy Systems:
- **Fast Writes**: New data written sequentially (like writing in a diary)
- **Eventual Organization**: Data gets sorted and optimized later
- **Compaction**: Old data gets reorganized for better read performance

### Real Example - Social Media Posts:
```
Problem: Facebook processes 4 billion posts per day

Traditional Database Approach:
- Each post needs to find correct position immediately
- Lots of random disk writes → Slow!

LSM Tree Approach:
1. New posts written to memory buffer (fast!)
2. Buffer gets full → Write entire buffer to disk sequentially
3. Background process merges and sorts files
4. Reads check memory first, then sorted files

Result: Can handle millions of writes per second!
```

## 2.3 Merkle Trees

### What is it?
Think of a family tree where each person has a unique "fingerprint" that depends on their children's fingerprints. If any child changes, the parent's fingerprint changes too. This creates a tamper-proof system!

### When to Use Merkle Trees:
1. **Data Integrity**: Verify data hasn't been corrupted
2. **Distributed Systems**: Git, BitTorrent, blockchain
3. **Backup Systems**: Detect which files have changed

### Why Merkle Trees for Data Integrity:
- **Tamper Detection**: Any change creates different fingerprint
- **Efficient Verification**: Don't need to check every piece of data
- **Distributed Sync**: Quickly find differences between systems

### Real Example - Git Version Control:
```
Problem: How does Git quickly detect if your code repository matches the remote?

Solution: Merkle Tree of file hashes

                Root Hash (abc123)
               /                 \
        Dir1 Hash (def456)    Dir2 Hash (789xyz)
        /            \              /         \
  file1.py      file2.py     file3.js    file4.js
  (hash1)       (hash2)      (hash3)     (hash4)

If you change file1.py:
1. file1.py gets new hash
2. Dir1 gets new hash (because child changed)
3. Root gets new hash (because child changed)

Git compares root hashes:
- Same → Repositories are identical
- Different → Find which subtree changed and sync only that part
```

---

## 3. Graphs

### What is it?
Think of a map showing cities connected by roads. Some cities connect to many others, some to few. This network of connections is a graph!

In system design, graphs represent relationships between entities.

### When to Use Graphs:
1. **Social Networks**: Friend relationships, followers
2. **Recommendation Systems**: "People who bought X also bought Y"
3. **Network Routing**: Internet traffic, CDN optimization
4. **Dependency Management**: Service dependencies, build systems

### Real Example - Social Network Friend Suggestions:

```
Problem: Facebook suggests new friends. How?

Graph Representation:
Users = Nodes
Friendships = Edges

    Alice ←→ Bob ←→ Charlie
      ↓        ↓
    David    Emma ←→ Frank

Algorithm: "Friends of Friends"
1. Find Alice's friends: [Bob, David]
2. Find friends of Alice's friends:
   - Bob's friends: [Alice, Charlie, Emma]
   - David's friends: [Alice]
3. Suggest people Alice isn't connected to: [Charlie, Emma]

Why this works: People often know friends of their friends!
```

### Graph Algorithms for System Design:

#### BFS (Breadth-First Search)
**Use case**: Find shortest path, level-by-level exploration

**Example**: LinkedIn showing "2nd degree connections"
```
You → Direct Connections → 2nd Degree Connections

Level 1: Your direct connections (friends)
Level 2: Friends of your friends (2nd degree)
Level 3: Friends of friends of friends (3rd degree)
```

#### DFS (Depth-First Search)
**Use case**: Detect cycles, dependency resolution

**Example**: Detecting circular dependencies in microservices
```
Service A depends on Service B
Service B depends on Service C
Service C depends on Service A ← CYCLE DETECTED!

DFS can find this cycle before deployment
```

## 4. Queues and Stacks

### What are they?
**Queue**: Like a line at Starbucks - first person in line gets served first (FIFO - First In, First Out)
**Stack**: Like a stack of plates - you can only take the top plate (LIFO - Last In, First Out)

### When to Use Queues:
1. **Task Processing**: Background jobs, email sending
2. **Rate Limiting**: Control request flow
3. **Message Systems**: Communication between services

### When to Use Stacks:
1. **Undo Operations**: Browser back button, text editor undo
2. **Function Calls**: How programming languages handle function calls
3. **Expression Evaluation**: Calculator operations

### Real Example - Background Job Processing:

```
Problem: E-commerce site needs to send confirmation emails without slowing down checkout

Without Queue:
User clicks "Buy" → Process payment → Send email → Show confirmation
If email service is slow, user waits! Bad experience!

With Queue:
User clicks "Buy" → Process payment → Add email to queue → Show confirmation immediately
Background worker: Takes emails from queue and sends them

Queue:
[Email to John] [Email to Sarah] [Email to Mike] [Email to Lisa]
     ↑                                              ↑
  Worker takes                              New emails added
  from front                                to back

Result: Fast user experience, reliable email delivery!
```

### Priority Queues

**What is it?**: A queue where some items are more important than others.

**Real Example - Hospital Emergency Room**:
```
Regular Queue: First come, first served
Priority Queue: Most urgent patients first

Patient Queue:
1. Heart attack (Priority 1 - URGENT)
2. Broken arm (Priority 3 - Medium)
3. Cold symptoms (Priority 5 - Low)
4. Car accident (Priority 1 - URGENT)

Processing order: Heart attack → Car accident → Broken arm → Cold

In system design: API rate limiting, task scheduling, resource allocation
```

## 5. Bloom Filters

### What is it?
Imagine you're a bouncer at an exclusive club. You have a list of VIP members, but checking the full list for every person takes too long. Instead, you have a quick "maybe" test:

1. If the test says "NO" → Definitely not a VIP
2. If the test says "MAYBE" → Check the full list

Bloom filters are that quick "maybe" test for data!

### How it Works (Simple):
```
Step 1: Hash the item multiple times
Step 2: Set bits in a bit array
Step 3: To check: hash item, check if all bits are set

Example: Adding "john@email.com"
hash1("john@email.com") = 5 → Set bit 5
hash2("john@email.com") = 12 → Set bit 12
hash3("john@email.com") = 25 → Set bit 25

Bit Array: [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]

To check if "jane@email.com" exists:
hash1("jane@email.com") = 5 → Bit 5 is set ✓
hash2("jane@email.com") = 15 → Bit 15 is NOT set ✗
Result: "jane@email.com" is definitely NOT in the set
```

### When to Use Bloom Filters:
1. **Database Query Optimization**: Avoid expensive disk reads
2. **Web Crawling**: Don't crawl same URLs twice
3. **Spam Detection**: Quick filtering before expensive checks
4. **Caching**: Check if data might be in cache

### Real Example - Database Optimization:

```
Problem: Check if user_id exists in massive database (1 billion users)

Without Bloom Filter:
Every query → Database lookup → Slow if user doesn't exist

With Bloom Filter:
1. Query bloom filter first (in memory, super fast)
2. If bloom filter says "NO" → User definitely doesn't exist, return immediately
3. If bloom filter says "MAYBE" → Check database

Result: 
- 90% of non-existent user queries answered instantly
- Only 10% require expensive database lookup
- 10x faster for negative queries!
```

### Trade-offs:
**Pros**: Super fast, memory efficient
**Cons**: False positives possible (says "maybe" when answer is "no"), cannot delete items

## 6. Tries (Prefix Trees)

### What is it?
Think of a dictionary where words are organized by their starting letters. All words starting with 'A' are together, then subdivided by their second letter, and so on.

A Trie organizes strings this way, making prefix-based searches extremely fast!

### How it Works:
```
Storing words: ["CAT", "CAR", "CARD", "DOG"]

        ROOT
       /    \
      C      D
      |      |
      A      O
     / \     |
    T   R    G
        |
        D

To find all words starting with "CA":
Follow path C→A, then explore all branches: CAT, CAR, CARD
```

### When to Use Tries:
1. **Autocomplete**: Search suggestions, command completion
2. **Spell Checkers**: Find similar words
3. **IP Routing**: Network routing tables
4. **URL Routing**: Web application routing

### Real Example - Search Autocomplete:

```
Problem: Google needs to show search suggestions as you type

User types: "face"
Trie contains: ["facebook", "facetime", "face mask", "facial", "faces"]

Search Process:
1. Start at root
2. Follow path: F → A → C → E
3. Explore all branches from "face" node
4. Return: ["facebook", "facetime", "face mask"]

Why Trie is perfect:
- Shared prefixes stored once (memory efficient)
- Suggestions found in O(prefix_length) time
- Easy to rank by popularity or frequency
```

# Essential Algorithms

## 1. Consistent Hashing

### What is the Problem?
Imagine you run a pizza delivery service with 3 drivers. You assign deliveries by customer phone number:
- Numbers ending 0-3: Driver A
- Numbers ending 4-6: Driver B  
- Numbers ending 7-9: Driver C

This works great! But what happens when Driver B gets sick and you only have 2 drivers? You need to reassign ALL customers! Chaos!

This is the problem with traditional hashing in distributed systems.

### What is Consistent Hashing?
Consistent hashing is like arranging your drivers in a circle and assigning customers to the nearest driver clockwise. When a driver leaves, only their customers need reassignment!

### How it Works:

```
Step 1: Create a hash ring (imagine a clock)
Step 2: Place servers on the ring
Step 3: Place data on the ring
Step 4: Data goes to the next server clockwise

     12 o'clock
         |
    Server A
         |
9 -------+------- 3
   Data X |     Server B
         |
    Server C
         |
     6 o'clock

Data X goes to Server B (next clockwise)
```

### When to Use Consistent Hashing:
1. **Load Balancing**: Distribute requests across servers
2. **Distributed Caching**: Spread cache data across nodes
3. **Database Sharding**: Partition data across databases
4. **CDN**: Route users to nearest server

### Real Example - Distributed Cache:

```
Problem: Memcached cluster with 5 servers needs to handle millions of cache requests

Traditional Hashing:
server = hash(key) % 5
"user_123" → hash = 847 → 847 % 5 = 2 → Server 2

Problem: If Server 2 dies:
- New formula: server = hash(key) % 4  
- "user_123" → 847 % 4 = 3 → Server 3
- ALL cache keys need to move! Cache miss storm!

Consistent Hashing Solution:
1. Hash ring with servers at: 72°, 144°, 216°, 288°, 360°
2. "user_123" hashes to 200° → goes to server at 216°
3. If server at 216° dies → data goes to next server at 288°
4. Only 1/5 of data needs to move, not everything!

Result: System stays stable when servers fail!
```

### Virtual Nodes (Advanced):
```
Problem: What if servers aren't evenly distributed on the ring?

Solution: Each physical server gets multiple "virtual nodes"
- Server A: positions 10°, 120°, 250°
- Server B: positions 45°, 180°, 310°  
- Server C: positions 80°, 200°, 340°

Result: Better load distribution even with different server sizes
```

---

## 2. Rate Limiting Algorithms

### Why Rate Limiting?
Imagine a popular restaurant that can serve 100 customers per hour. Without reservations, 500 people might show up in one hour, overwhelming the kitchen and ruining everyone's experience.

Rate limiting is like a reservation system for your API!

## 2.1 Token Bucket Algorithm

### What is it?
Think of a bucket that collects tokens (permissions) at a steady rate. Each request needs a token. If the bucket is empty, requests must wait.

### How it Works:
```
Bucket Capacity: 10 tokens
Refill Rate: 2 tokens per second

Second 1: Bucket has 10 tokens, 5 requests come → 5 tokens used, 5 remain
Second 2: Add 2 tokens → 7 tokens total, 3 requests come → 4 tokens remain  
Second 3: Add 2 tokens → 6 tokens total, 8 requests come → Reject 2 requests!
```

### When to Use Token Bucket:
1. **API Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
2. **Traffic Shaping**: Smooth out bursty traffic  
3. **Resource Allocation**: CPU, memory, bandwidth limits

### Real Example - API Rate Limiting:

```
Problem: Twitter API allows 300 requests per 15 minutes per user

Token Bucket Implementation:
- Bucket size: 300 tokens
- Refill rate: 300 tokens / 15 minutes = 20 tokens per minute

User makes requests:
Minute 1: 50 requests → 250 tokens left
Minute 2: Add 20 tokens → 270 tokens, 100 requests → 170 tokens left
Minute 3: Add 20 tokens → 190 tokens, 200 requests → 10 tokens left  
Minute 4: Add 20 tokens → 30 tokens, 50 requests → Reject 20 requests

Benefits:
- Allows bursts (user can use all 300 quickly if needed)
- Fair over time (always gets 20 new tokens per minute)
- Simple to implement and understand
```

## 2.2 Leaky Bucket Algorithm

### What is it?
Imagine a bucket with a hole at the bottom that drains water at a constant rate. Water (requests) pours in at the top, but can only flow out at the fixed drain rate.

### When to Use Leaky Bucket:
1. **Strict Rate Enforcement**: Need constant output rate
2. **Network Traffic Shaping**: Smooth variable input
3. **Queue Management**: Process items at steady pace

### Real Example - Video Streaming:

```
Problem: Video streaming needs constant bitrate to prevent buffering

Leaky Bucket for Video:
- Input: Variable network packets (sometimes fast, sometimes slow)
- Bucket: Buffer to smooth out variations
- Output: Steady 1080p video stream at 5 Mbps

Result: Viewers get smooth video even with variable internet
```

## 2.3 Sliding Window Algorithm

### What is it?
Instead of fixed time periods, maintain a moving window of recent activity. Like looking at the last 60 seconds of requests instead of the current minute.

### When to Use Sliding Window:
1. **Precise Rate Limiting**: More accurate than fixed windows
2. **Real-time Analytics**: Moving averages
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Detect sudden spikes

### Real Example - DDoS Protection:

```
Problem: Detect if a user is making too many requests (possible attack)

Fixed Window Problem:
Window 1 (0-60s): 90 requests  → OK
Window 2 (60-120s): 90 requests → OK
But: 90 requests at 59s + 90 requests at 61s = 180 requests in 2 seconds!

Sliding Window Solution:
At any moment, check requests in the last 60 seconds
At 61s: Check requests from 1s to 61s → Detect the 180 requests in 2s!

Result: Better protection against burst attacks
```

---

## 3. Load Balancing Algorithms

### Why Load Balancing?
Imagine a busy bank with 5 tellers. Without coordination, all customers might go to the first teller while others sit idle. Load balancing distributes customers evenly!

## 3.1 Round Robin

### What is it?
Send requests to servers in order: Server 1, Server 2, Server 3, then back to Server 1.

### When to Use:
- **Equal servers**: All servers have same capacity
- **Simple setup**: Easy to implement and understand
- **Stateless requests**: Requests don't depend on previous ones

### Example:
```
Servers: [A, B, C]
Requests: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Distribution:
Request 1 → Server A
Request 2 → Server B  
Request 3 → Server C
Request 4 → Server A
Request 5 → Server B
Request 6 → Server C

Result: Each server handles 2 requests
```

## 3.2 Weighted Round Robin

### What is it?
Like round robin, but some servers are stronger and can handle more requests.

### When to Use:
- **Different server capacities**: New servers vs old servers
- **Gradual deployment**: Slowly shift traffic to new version
- **Cost optimization**: Expensive servers handle more traffic

### Example:
```
Servers: 
- Server A (weight 3): Powerful server
- Server B (weight 2): Medium server
- Server C (weight 1): Weak server

Distribution pattern: A, A, A, B, B, C (repeat)

Requests: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Request 1 → Server A
Request 2 → Server A  
Request 3 → Server A
Request 4 → Server B
Request 5 → Server B
Request 6 → Server C
Request 7 → Server A (start new cycle)
...

Result: A handles 50%, B handles 33%, C handles 17%
```

## 3.3 Least Connections

### What is it?
Send new requests to the server currently handling the fewest active connections.

### When to Use:
- **Variable request duration**: Some requests take longer than others
- **Real-time applications**: WebSocket connections, streaming
- **Dynamic balancing**: Adapt to actual server load

### Example:
```
Current state:
- Server A: 5 active connections
- Server B: 3 active connections  
- Server C: 7 active connections

New request arrives → Goes to Server B (least connections)

After request:
- Server A: 5 active connections
- Server B: 4 active connections
- Server C: 7 active connections

Result: Automatically balances based on actual load
```

## 4. Cache Eviction Policies

### Why Cache Eviction?
Caches have limited space. When full, you need to decide which data to remove to make room for new data. It's like deciding which books to keep when your bookshelf is full!

## 4.1 LRU (Least Recently Used)

### What is it?
Remove the data that hasn't been accessed for the longest time. Like cleaning out clothes you haven't worn in years.

### How it Works:
```
Cache with capacity 3:

Step 1: Add A → [A]
Step 2: Add B → [A, B]  
Step 3: Add C → [A, B, C]
Step 4: Access A → [B, C, A] (A moved to most recent)
Step 5: Add D → [C, A, D] (B evicted - least recently used)
```

### When to Use LRU:
1. **Web Applications**: Browser cache, CDN cache
2. **Database Buffers**: Keep frequently accessed pages in memory
3. **General Purpose**: Good default choice for most applications

### Real Example - Web Browser Cache:

```
Problem: Browser cache can store 100 web pages, user visits 101st page

LRU Implementation:
1. Track when each page was last accessed
2. When cache is full, remove oldest accessed page
3. Add new page

Scenario:
User visits: Google, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Google (again), YouTube

Cache evolution:
[Google] → [Google, Facebook] → [Google, Facebook, Twitter] 
→ [Google, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail] (evict Google - oldest)
→ [Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Google] (Google accessed again)
→ [Twitter, Gmail, Google, YouTube] (evict Facebook - oldest)

Result: Recently visited sites load instantly from cache!
```

### Implementation with Hash Map + Doubly Linked List:
```
Why this combination?
- Hash Map: O(1) lookup to find if item exists
- Doubly Linked List: O(1) to move item to front/remove from back

Operations:
- Get(key): Hash map lookup + move to front of list
- Put(key, value): Add to front + remove from back if full
- Both operations: O(1) time complexity!
```

## 4.2 LFU (Least Frequently Used)

### What is it?
Remove the data that has been accessed the fewest times. Like getting rid of the book you've only read once vs the one you read monthly.

### When to Use LFU:
1. **Analytics Systems**: Keep popular reports in cache
2. **Content Delivery**: Cache popular videos/images
3. **Database Query Cache**: Popular queries stay cached longer

### Real Example - Video Streaming:

```
Problem: Netflix caches popular movies at edge servers (limited storage)

LFU Implementation:
Track how many times each movie is watched

Movies in cache:
- Avengers: 1000 views
- Stranger Things: 800 views  
- The Office: 500 views
- Obscure Documentary: 5 views

New popular movie needs space → Remove Obscure Documentary (lowest frequency)

Result: Popular content stays cached, improving user experience
```

## 5. Graph Algorithms for System Design

## 5.1 BFS (Breadth-First Search)

### What is it?
Explore all neighbors at current level before going deeper. Like ripples in a pond - explore outward layer by layer.

### When to Use BFS:
1. **Shortest Path**: Find minimum steps between two points
2. **Social Networks**: Degrees of separation
3. **Network Routing**: Find shortest network path
4. **Level-order Processing**: Process by distance/relationship

### Real Example - LinkedIn Connections:

```
Problem: Show user how they're connected to someone else

Network:
You → [Alice, Bob, Charlie] (1st degree)
Alice → [David, Emma] (2nd degree)  
Bob → [Frank, Emma] (2nd degree)
David → [Target Person] (3rd degree)

BFS to find connection to Target Person:
Level 1: Check Alice, Bob, Charlie → Not found
Level 2: Check David, Emma, Frank → Not found  
Level 3: Check connections of David → Found Target Person!

Result: "You're connected to Target Person through Alice → David"
Path length: 3 degrees of separation
```

### BFS Implementation for System Design:
```python
def find_connection_path(start_user, target_user, max_degrees=3):
    queue = [(start_user, [start_user])]
    visited = {start_user}
    
    for degree in range(max_degrees):
        level_size = len(queue)
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            current_user, path = queue.pop(0)
            
            # Check all friends of current user
            for friend in get_friends(current_user):
                if friend == target_user:
                    return path + [friend]  # Found connection!
                
                if friend not in visited:
                    visited.add(friend)
                    queue.append((friend, path + [friend]))
    
    return None  # No connection within max_degrees
```

## 5.2 DFS (Depth-First Search)

### What is it?
Go as deep as possible down one path before backtracking. Like exploring a maze by following one path to its end before trying another.

### When to Use DFS:
1. **Cycle Detection**: Find circular dependencies
2. **Topological Sorting**: Order tasks by dependencies
3. **Path Finding**: Find if path exists (not necessarily shortest)
4. **Component Analysis**: Find connected groups

### Real Example - Microservice Dependency Resolution:

```
Problem: Deploy microservices in correct order based on dependencies

Dependencies:
- User Service depends on Database Service
- Payment Service depends on User Service  
- Order Service depends on Payment Service and Inventory Service
- Inventory Service depends on Database Service

Graph:
Database → User Service → Payment Service → Order Service
Database → Inventory Service → Order Service

DFS for Topological Sort:
1. Start from nodes with no dependencies: Database Service
2. Deploy Database Service
3. Deploy User Service (dependency satisfied)
4. Deploy Inventory Service (dependency satisfied)  
5. Deploy Payment Service (dependency satisfied)
6. Deploy Order Service (all dependencies satisfied)

Result: Services deployed in correct order, no failures!
```

### Cycle Detection with DFS:
```python
def has_circular_dependency(services):
    WHITE, GRAY, BLACK = 0, 1, 2
    color = {service: WHITE for service in services}
    
    def dfs(service):
        if color[service] == GRAY:
            return True  # Back edge found - cycle detected!
        
        if color[service] == BLACK:
            return False  # Already processed
        
        color[service] = GRAY  # Mark as being processed
        
        # Check all dependencies
        for dependency in get_dependencies(service):
            if dfs(dependency):
                return True
        
        color[service] = BLACK  # Mark as fully processed
        return False
    
    # Check each service
    for service in services:
        if color[service] == WHITE:
            if dfs(service):
                return True  # Cycle found
    
    return False
```

# Advanced System Design Concepts

## 1. CAP Theorem

### What is CAP Theorem?
Imagine you're running a chain of restaurants with multiple locations. You face a fundamental choice about how to manage your menu and orders:

**C**onsistency: All locations have the exact same menu at all times
**A**vailability: Every location can always take orders  
**P**artition Tolerance: Locations can operate even if communication between them fails

**CAP Theorem says: You can only guarantee 2 out of 3!**

### Real-World Examples:

#### CP System (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)
**Example**: Banking System
```
Scenario: Bank with branches in New York and London

Consistency: Account balance must be identical at both branches
Partition Tolerance: Branches can lose connection but still operate

Trade-off: If connection fails and you can't verify balance consistency,
          the system blocks transactions (sacrifices Availability)

Result: You might not be able to withdraw money, but you'll never 
        accidentally overdraw due to inconsistent data
```

#### AP System (Availability + Partition Tolerance)  
**Example**: Social Media Feed
```
Scenario: Facebook's global servers

Availability: Users can always post and read content
Partition Tolerance: Local servers work even if global connection fails

Trade-off: Your friend's post might not appear in your feed immediately
          (sacrifices strong Consistency)

Result: Users always have access to the platform, but data might be 
        temporarily inconsistent across regions
```

#### CA System (Consistency + Availability)
**Example**: Single-node database
```
Scenario: Traditional single-server database

Consistency: All reads return the same data
Availability: Database always responds to requests

Trade-off: Cannot handle network partitions - if server fails, 
          entire system goes down (no Partition Tolerance)

Result: Perfect consistency and availability, but not fault-tolerant
```

### How to Choose:

**Choose CP when**:
- Data correctness is critical (financial transactions, inventory)
- Better to be unavailable than inconsistent
- Examples: Banking systems, e-commerce inventory

**Choose AP when**:
- User experience is priority
- Some inconsistency is acceptable temporarily  
- Examples: Social media, content platforms, recommendation systems

**Choose CA when**:
- Single-node systems
- No distribution required
- Examples: Traditional relational databases, small applications

## 2. ACID vs BASE

### ACID Properties (Traditional Databases)

Think of ACID like a very strict accountant who never makes mistakes:

#### **A**tomicity
**What**: All-or-nothing transactions
**Example**: 
```
Bank Transfer: $100 from Account A to Account B

Operation 1: Subtract $100 from Account A  
Operation 2: Add $100 to Account B

Atomicity ensures:
- Either BOTH operations succeed
- Or BOTH operations fail
- Never: Money disappears or gets duplicated
```

#### **C**onsistency  
**What**: Database always remains in valid state
**Example**:
```
Rule: Account balance cannot be negative

Before transaction: Account A = $50
Attempt: Transfer $100 from Account A

Consistency check: $50 - $100 = -$50 (violates rule)
Result: Transaction rejected, Account A stays at $50
```

#### **I**solation
**What**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
**Example**:
```
Two simultaneous transfers from Account A ($100 balance):
Transaction 1: Transfer $60 to Account B
Transaction 2: Transfer $70 to Account C

Without isolation: Both might see $100, both succeed → Balance = -$30!
With isolation: One completes first, second sees updated balance → One fails
```

#### **D**urability
**What**: Committed data survives system failures
**Example**:
```
Transaction: Purchase confirmed, inventory decremented
System crash: 2 seconds later, server dies
After restart: Purchase still recorded, inventory still decremented

Durability ensures: Data written to persistent storage, not just memory
```

### BASE Properties (NoSQL/Distributed Systems)

Think of BASE like a relaxed manager who prioritizes getting things done:

#### **B**asically **A**vailable
**What**: System remains operational most of the time
**Example**:
```
Amazon's shopping cart during Black Friday:
- Some servers might be overloaded
- Some features might be slower
- But you can still browse and buy products
- 99.9% availability vs 100% perfect consistency
```

#### **S**oft State
**What**: Data might be inconsistent temporarily  
**Example**:
```
Twitter follower count:
- You follow someone → Your "following" count increases immediately
- Their "followers" count might update a few seconds later
- Eventually both numbers will be consistent
- Short-term inconsistency for better performance
```

#### **E**ventual Consistency
**What**: All replicas will be consistent eventually
**Example**:
```
Facebook post workflow:
1. You post a photo in New York
2. Friends in New York see it immediately (local server)
3. Friends in London see it 2 seconds later (replication delay)
4. Friends in Tokyo see it 5 seconds later (further replication)
5. After 30 seconds: All servers have the same data

Result: Fast local access, global consistency over time
```

### When to Use Each:

**Use ACID when**:
- Financial transactions
- Inventory management  
- Legal/compliance requirements
- Data correctness is paramount

**Use BASE when**:
- Social media platforms
- Content management
- Analytics and logging
- User experience over perfect consistency

## 3. Caching Strategies

### Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)

**What**: Application manages cache manually - check cache first, then database

**How it works**:
```
Read Process:
1. Application checks cache for data
2. If found (cache hit): Return data from cache
3. If not found (cache miss): 
   a. Fetch data from database
   b. Store data in cache
   c. Return data to user

Write Process:
1. Write data to database
2. Invalidate cache entry (remove stale data)
```

**When to use**:
- Read-heavy applications
- Expensive database queries
- Application has complex caching logic

**Real Example - User Profile Service**:
```python
def get_user_profile(user_id):
    # Step 1: Check cache
    profile = cache.get(f"user_profile:{user_id}")
    
    if profile:
        return profile  # Cache hit!
    
    # Step 2: Cache miss - fetch from database
    profile = database.get_user_profile(user_id)
    
    # Step 3: Store in cache for next time
    cache.set(f"user_profile:{user_id}", profile, ttl=3600)
    
    return profile

def update_user_profile(user_id, new_data):
    # Step 1: Update database
    database.update_user_profile(user_id, new_data)
    
    # Step 2: Remove stale cache entry
    cache.delete(f"user_profile:{user_id}")
```

**Pros**: Simple, only caches what's needed
**Cons**: Extra code in application, cache misses cause delay

### Write-Through Cache

**What**: Cache and database updated simultaneously

**How it works**:
```
Write Process:
1. Application writes to cache
2. Cache immediately writes to database  
3. Both cache and database are always in sync

Read Process:
1. Application reads from cache (always has data)
```

**When to use**:
- Write consistency is critical
- Can tolerate slower writes
- Read performance is priority

**Real Example - Configuration Service**:
```python
class ConfigurationService:
    def set_config(self, key, value):
        # Step 1: Write to cache
        cache.set(key, value)
        
        # Step 2: Immediately write to database
        database.set_config(key, value)
        
        # Both are now consistent
    
    def get_config(self, key):
        # Always read from cache (guaranteed to be there)
        return cache.get(key)
```

**Pros**: Always consistent, fast reads
**Cons**: Slower writes, unnecessary database writes

### Write-Behind (Write-Back) Cache

**What**: Cache updated immediately, database updated later asynchronously

**How it works**:
```
Write Process:
1. Application writes to cache (fast!)
2. Cache marks data as "dirty"
3. Background process writes dirty data to database
4. Cache marks data as "clean"

Read Process:
1. Application reads from cache (always fast)
```

**When to use**:
- Write-heavy applications
- Can tolerate some data loss risk
- Need maximum write performance

**Real Example - Gaming Leaderboard**:
```python
class GameLeaderboard:
    def update_score(self, player_id, score):
        # Step 1: Update cache immediately (fast for player)
        cache.set(f"score:{player_id}", score)
        cache.mark_dirty(f"score:{player_id}")
        
        # Player sees updated score instantly!
    
    def background_sync(self):
        # Runs every 30 seconds
        dirty_entries = cache.get_dirty_entries()
        
        for entry in dirty_entries:
            # Batch write to database
            database.update_score(entry.player_id, entry.score)
            cache.mark_clean(entry.key)
```

**Pros**: Fastest writes, good for burst traffic
**Cons**: Risk of data loss, complexity of background sync

### Cache Coherence in Multi-Level Caches

**Problem**: What happens when you have browser cache, CDN cache, and server cache?

**Real Example - News Website**:
```
Cache Levels:
1. Browser Cache (user's computer): 5 minutes
2. CDN Cache (edge servers): 15 minutes  
3. Application Cache (server): 60 minutes
4. Database (source of truth)

Problem: News article updated, but users see old version!

Solution - Cache Invalidation Strategy:
1. Update database
2. Invalidate application cache
3. Send invalidation to CDN
4. Set cache headers to force browser refresh

Result: New article visible everywhere within minutes
```

# Real-World System Design Examples

## Example 1: Design a URL Shortener (like bit.ly)

Let's design a complete URL shortening service using the concepts we've learned!

### Requirements:
- Shorten long URLs to short codes (bit.ly/abc123)
- Redirect short codes to original URLs
- Handle 100 million URLs per day
- 100:1 read/write ratio (more clicks than creations)

### Step-by-Step Design:

#### 1. Choose Data Structures

**Hash Table for URL Storage**:
```
Why: Need O(1) lookup for redirects
Structure: short_code → original_url

Example:
{
    "abc123": "https://www.verylongurl.com/some/deep/path",
    "xyz789": "https://www.anotherlongurl.com/page"
}
```

**For Distributed Storage - Consistent Hashing**:
```
Why: Distribute URLs across multiple databases
How: hash(short_code) → determines which database

Database 1: short_codes starting with a-d
Database 2: short_codes starting with e-h  
Database 3: short_codes starting with i-l
...
```

#### 2. Algorithm for Short Code Generation

**Base62 Encoding**:
```python
def generate_short_code(url_id):
    """Convert numeric ID to base62 string"""
    chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789"
    base = len(chars)
    
    result = ""
    while url_id > 0:
        result = chars[url_id % base] + result
        url_id //= base
    
    return result

# Example: ID 125 → "cb" (short code)
```

**Why Base62?**:
- Uses letters + numbers (URL-safe)
- 6 characters = 62^6 = 56 billion possible codes
- Much shorter than UUIDs

#### 3. Caching Strategy

**Multi-Level Caching** (Cache-Aside pattern):
```python
def redirect_url(short_code):
    # Level 1: Application cache (Redis)
    url = redis_cache.get(short_code)
    if url:
        return url  # Super fast!
    
    # Level 2: Database lookup
    url = database.get_url(short_code)
    if url:
        # Cache for future requests
        redis_cache.set(short_code, url, ttl=3600)
        return url
    
    return None  # URL not found

def create_short_url(original_url):
    # Generate unique ID
    url_id = database.get_next_id()
    short_code = generate_short_code(url_id)
    
    # Store in database
    database.store_url(short_code, original_url)
    
    # Pre-populate cache (Write-Through)
    redis_cache.set(short_code, original_url, ttl=3600)
    
    return short_code
```

#### 4. Handle Scale - Sharding

**Consistent Hashing for Database Sharding**:
```python
def get_database_shard(short_code):
    """Determine which database contains this short code"""
    hash_value = hash(short_code)
    shard_number = hash_value % NUMBER_OF_SHARDS
    return database_shards[shard_number]

def get_url(short_code):
    # Find correct database shard
    db_shard = get_database_shard(short_code)
    
    # Query specific shard
    return db_shard.get_url(short_code)
```

#### 5. Rate Limiting

**Token Bucket for API Protection**:
```python
def create_url_with_rate_limit(user_id, original_url):
    # Check rate limit (100 URLs per hour per user)
    bucket = get_token_bucket(user_id)
    
    if not bucket.consume_token():
        raise RateLimitExceeded("Too many URLs created")
    
    return create_short_url(original_url)

class TokenBucket:
    def __init__(self, capacity=100, refill_rate=100/3600):  # 100 per hour
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.tokens = capacity
        self.refill_rate = refill_rate
        self.last_refill = time.time()
    
    def consume_token(self):
        self._refill()
        if self.tokens >= 1:
            self.tokens -= 1
            return True
        return False
```

#### 6. Complete Architecture

```
[User Request] 
    ↓
[Load Balancer] → Round Robin to distribute load
    ↓
[Web Servers] → Stateless application servers
    ↓
[Cache Layer] → Redis cluster (Cache-Aside)
    ↓
[Database Shards] → Consistent hashing for distribution
    ↓
[Analytics DB] → Track clicks (separate system)
```

### Performance Analysis:

**Read Path (Redirect)**:
1. Cache hit: ~1ms response time
2. Cache miss + DB: ~50ms response time  
3. 99% cache hit ratio → Average ~2ms

**Write Path (Create URL)**:
1. Generate ID: ~1ms
2. Database write: ~10ms
3. Cache write: ~1ms
4. Total: ~12ms

**Scale Handling**:
- 100M URLs/day = 1,157 writes/second (easily handled)
- 10B redirects/day = 115,740 reads/second
- With caching: ~1,157 DB reads/second (very manageable)

## Example 2: Design a Chat System (WhatsApp-like)

### Requirements:
- Send/receive messages in real-time
- Support group chats
- Message delivery confirmation
- Handle millions of concurrent users
- Message history storage

### Step-by-Step Design:

#### 1. Real-Time Communication

**WebSocket Connections**:
```
Problem: HTTP is request-response, but chat needs bidirectional real-time communication

Solution: WebSocket persistent connections
- User opens app → Establishes WebSocket connection
- Connection stays open for real-time messaging
- Server can push messages to user instantly
```

**Connection Management**:
```python
class ChatServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_connections = {}  # user_id → websocket_connection
        self.connection_servers = {}  # user_id → server_instance
    
    def handle_new_connection(self, user_id, websocket):
        # Store user's connection
        self.user_connections[user_id] = websocket
        self.connection_servers[user_id] = self.server_id
        
        # Update user's online status
        self.set_user_online(user_id)
    
    def send_message(self, from_user, to_user, message):
        # Check if recipient is connected to this server
        if to_user in self.user_connections:
            # Direct delivery - same server
            websocket = self.user_connections[to_user]
            websocket.send(message)
        else:
            # Route through message queue to correct server
            target_server = self.connection_servers.get(to_user)
            if target_server:
                message_queue.publish(target_server, message)
```

#### 2. Message Storage and Retrieval

**Cassandra with Time-Series Design**:
```
Why Cassandra:
- Excellent for write-heavy workloads (billions of messages)
- Time-series data (messages have timestamps)
- Automatic partitioning and replication

Table Design:
CREATE TABLE messages (
    chat_id UUID,
    message_time TIMESTAMP,
    message_id UUID,
    sender_id UUID,
    content TEXT,
    message_type TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (chat_id, message_time, message_id)
);

Query Pattern:
- Get recent messages: SELECT * FROM messages WHERE chat_id = ? ORDER BY message_time DESC LIMIT 50
- Time-based pagination works naturally
```

**Message Queue for Reliability**:
```python
def send_message(chat_id, sender_id, content):
    message = {
        'message_id': generate_uuid(),
        'chat_id': chat_id,
        'sender_id': sender_id,
        'content': content,
        'timestamp': current_time(),
        'status': 'sent'
    }
    
    # Step 1: Store in database (durability)
    database.store_message(message)
    
    # Step 2: Add to delivery queue
    message_queue.publish('message_delivery', message)
    
    # Step 3: Return to sender (they see message immediately)
    return message

def process_message_delivery(message):
    # Find all recipients in the chat
    recipients = get_chat_members(message['chat_id'])
    
    for recipient_id in recipients:
        if recipient_id != message['sender_id']:  # Don't send to sender
            # Try immediate delivery
            if is_user_online(recipient_id):
                deliver_to_user(recipient_id, message)
                update_message_status(message['message_id'], 'delivered')
            else:
                # Store for later delivery (push notification)
                store_pending_message(recipient_id, message)
```

#### 3. Message Delivery States

**State Management with Bloom Filters**:
```python
class MessageDeliveryTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        # Bloom filter for quick "definitely not delivered" checks
        self.delivery_bloom = BloomFilter(capacity=1000000, error_rate=0.1)
        
        # Precise tracking in database for confirmed deliveries
        self.delivery_db = database.get_table('message_delivery')
    
    def mark_delivered(self, message_id, user_id):
        delivery_key = f"{message_id}:{user_id}"
        
        # Add to bloom filter
        self.delivery_bloom.add(delivery_key)
        
        # Store precise record
        self.delivery_db.insert({
            'message_id': message_id,
            'user_id': user_id,
            'delivered_at': current_time()
        })
    
    def is_delivered(self, message_id, user_id):
        delivery_key = f"{message_id}:{user_id}"
        
        # Quick check with bloom filter
        if delivery_key not in self.delivery_bloom:
            return False  # Definitely not delivered
        
        # Bloom filter says "maybe" - check database
        return self.delivery_db.exists(message_id, user_id)
```

#### 4. Group Chat Scaling

**Fan-out Strategies**:
```python
def send_group_message(group_id, sender_id, message):
    group_members = get_group_members(group_id)
    
    if len(group_members) < 100:
        # Small group: Push model (immediate fan-out)
        for member_id in group_members:
            if member_id != sender_id:
                send_to_user(member_id, message)
    else:
        # Large group: Pull model (lazy loading)
        # Store message in group timeline
        store_group_message(group_id, message)
        
        # Notify active users only
        active_members = get_active_group_members(group_id)
        for member_id in active_members:
            if member_id != sender_id:
                notify_new_message(member_id, group_id)

def get_group_messages(group_id, user_id, last_seen_time):
    """Pull model: User requests recent messages"""
    return database.get_messages_since(group_id, last_seen_time)
```

#### 5. Load Balancing and Sharding

**Consistent Hashing for Chat Distribution**:
```python
def get_chat_server(chat_id):
    """Determine which server handles this chat"""
    hash_value = hash(chat_id)
    server_index = hash_value % len(chat_servers)
    return chat_servers[server_index]

def route_message(message):
    chat_id = message['chat_id']
    target_server = get_chat_server(chat_id)
    
    if target_server == current_server:
        # Handle locally
        process_message_locally(message)
    else:
        # Forward to correct server
        forward_message(target_server, message)
```

#### 6. Presence and Online Status

**Redis for Real-time Presence**:
```python
class PresenceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis = Redis()
        self.presence_ttl = 30  # 30 seconds
    
    def set_user_online(self, user_id):
        """Mark user as online with auto-expiry"""
        self.redis.setex(f"presence:{user_id}", self.presence_ttl, "online")
    
    def heartbeat(self, user_id):
        """User sends heartbeat every 15 seconds"""
        self.set_user_online(user_id)
    
    def is_user_online(self, user_id):
        """Check if user is currently online"""
        return self.redis.exists(f"presence:{user_id}")
    
    def get_online_friends(self, user_id):
        """Get list of user's friends who are online"""
        friends = get_user_friends(user_id)
        online_friends = []
        
        # Batch check for efficiency
        keys = [f"presence:{friend_id}" for friend_id in friends]
        results = self.redis.mget(keys)
        
        for i, result in enumerate(results):
            if result:  # Friend is online
                online_friends.append(friends[i])
        
        return online_friends
```

### Complete Architecture:
```
[Mobile Apps] 
    ↓ (WebSocket)
[Load Balancer] → Consistent hashing by user_id
    ↓
[Chat Servers] → Stateful servers maintaining WebSocket connections
    ↓
[Message Queue] → RabbitMQ/Kafka for reliable delivery
    ↓
[Cassandra Cluster] → Message storage (time-series)
    ↓
[Redis Cluster] → Presence, caching, temporary data
```

### Performance Characteristics:

**Message Latency**:
- Same server: ~5ms
- Cross-server: ~50ms  
- Offline delivery: Push notification + background sync

**Throughput**:
- 1 million concurrent connections per server
- 100,000 messages/second per server
- Horizontal scaling by adding servers

**Storage**:
- 1 billion messages/day = ~100GB/day
- Cassandra auto-partitioning by time
- Automatic replication for fault tolerance

This chat system design uses almost every concept we've covered:
- Hash tables for fast lookups
- Consistent hashing for distribution
- Message queues for reliability
- Bloom filters for efficiency
- Caching strategies for performance
- Real-time algorithms for presence

**Key Decisions to Make**:
1. **Push vs Pull vs Hybrid** for feed generation
2. **Caching strategy** for millions of users
3. **Storage** for posts and user relationships
4. **Ranking algorithm** for post ordering

**Think About**:
- How do you handle celebrities with millions of followers?
- How do you ensure feeds load quickly?
- How do you handle the "thundering herd" problem when a celebrity posts?

**Data Structures & Algorithms to Consider**:
- Graph algorithms for follower relationships
- Priority queues for feed ranking
- LRU cache for user feeds
- Consistent hashing for post distribution

## Scenario 2: Design a Distributed Cache

**Challenge**: Build Redis-like distributed caching system

**Key Decisions**:
1. **Web crawling** strategy and politeness
2. **Index structure** for billions of documents
3. **Ranking algorithm** for search results
4. **Query processing** for fast responses

**Think About**:
- How do you crawl the entire web efficiently?
- How do you store and search billions of documents?
- How do you rank results by relevance?
- How do you handle typos and synonyms?

**Data Structures & Algorithms to Consider**:
- Tries for auto-complete
- Inverted indexes for document search
- PageRank algorithm for ranking
- Bloom filters to avoid re-crawling
