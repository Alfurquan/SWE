# Leader election

Leader Election is a process used in distributed systems to designate one node as the leader or coordinator among a group of nodes.

The leader is responsible for managing shared tasks, such as coordinating updates, handling client requests, or managing distributed state. The key idea is that, at any given time, the system should operate with a single leader so that decisions can be made consistently and conflicts avoided.

## Why leader election is important ?

In distributed systems, leader election is crucial because:

- Consistency and Coordination: A leader provides a single source of truth, ensuring that all nodes work in a coordinated manner. This is especially important in tasks like distributed consensus, data replication, and managing shared resources.

- Fault Tolerance: In a dynamic system, nodes can fail or become unreachable. Leader election algorithms help the system detect such failures and elect a new leader, ensuring the system continues to operate smoothly.

- Efficiency: Centralizing coordination in one leader simplifies decision-making processes, reducing the complexity that would arise if every node tried to coordinate independently.

- Simplifying Complex Operations: For operations such as writing to a shared database or updating configuration settings, having a single leader reduces the chance of conflicts and data inconsistencies.

## How leader election works ?

Leader election involves several key steps:

- Initiation: When a leader is needed (e.g., at startup or when the current leader fails), all nodes participate in the election process.
- Proposal: Each node proposes itself as a candidate or suggests another node based on certain criteria (like a unique identifier, uptime, or resource capacity).
- Voting: Nodes exchange messages and vote on which candidate should become the leader. The candidate with the most votes, or that meets specific criteria, is selected as the leader.
- Announcement: Once a leader is elected, the result is communicated to all nodes. The elected leader then assumes responsibility for coordination.
- Monitoring and Re-election: The leader is continuously monitored. If it fails or becomes unresponsive, the system triggers a new leader election.
