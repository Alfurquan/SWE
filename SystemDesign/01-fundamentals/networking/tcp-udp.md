# TCP vs UDP

At the heart of the Internet are protocols that define how data is sent and received. TCP and UDP are two key protocols in the transport layer of the Internet protocol suite.

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): A connection-oriented protocol that ensures data is delivered accurately and in order. It’s like sending a certified mail where every step is tracked, and you’re guaranteed delivery.

- UDP (User Datagram Protocol): A connectionless protocol that sends data without establishing a dedicated connection. Think of it like sending postcards—fast and lightweight, but without a guarantee that every postcard will arrive or in the order sent.
