# HTTP/HTTPS

## What is HTTP ?

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between clients (like web browsers) and servers. When you type a URL into your browser, HTTP is the protocol that governs how your request is sent and how the response is received.

## What is HTTPS ?

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is essentially HTTP with an added layer of security. It uses encryption protocols—typically TLS (Transport Layer Security) or its predecessor SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)—to protect the data transmitted between the client and server.

### Why HTTPS?

- Data Encryption: Encrypts the data in transit, ensuring that sensitive information (like login credentials, credit card numbers, etc.) is not intercepted by malicious actors.
- Data Integrity: Ensures that the data sent and received is not tampered with during transmission.
- Authentication: Provides a mechanism for the client to verify the server’s identity, reducing the risk of connecting to fraudulent websites.
