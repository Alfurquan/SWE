# Availability

Availability refers to the proportion of time a system is operational and accessible when required.

Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)

## Strategies for Improving Availability

### Redundancy

Redundancy involves having backup components that can take over when primary components fail.

### Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck, enhancing both performance and availability.

### Failover Mechanisms

Failover mechanisms automatically switch to a redundant system when a failure is detected.

### Data Replication

Data replication involves copying data from one location to another to ensure that data is available even if one location fails.

- **Synchronous Replication:** Data is replicated in real-time to ensure consistency across locations.
- **Asynchronous Replication:** Data is replicated with a delay, which can be more efficient but may result in slight data inconsistencies.

### Monitoring and Alerts

Continuous health monitoring involves checking the status of system components to detect failures early and trigger alerts for immediate action.

- **Heartbeat Signals:** Regular signals sent between components to check their status.

- **Health Checks:** Automated scripts or tools that perform regular health checks on components.

- **Alerting Systems:** Tools like PagerDuty or OpsGenie that notify administrators of detected issues.
