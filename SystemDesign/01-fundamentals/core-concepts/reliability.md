# Reliability

In the world of software engineering, reliability is all about ensuring that systems work as expected—consistently and continuously—even in the face of unexpected challenges.

## What is Reliability?

In simple terms, reliability is the ability of the system to perform its intended function consistently over time.

A reliable system is one that

- Remains operational: It continues to work even when parts of it fail.
- Recovers quickly: It can bounce back from errors or unexpected events.
- Meets expectations: It delivers a consistent user experience, regardless of external factors.
