# Client Server Architecture

Whether you're browsing the web, sending an email, or using a cloud-based application, you’re interacting with a system designed around the client-server model.

## What is client server architecture

Client-server architecture is a computing model in which multiple clients (users or devices) interact with a centralized server to access data, resources, or services.

Key components

- Client: The client is typically a device or application that initiates a request to the server. This could be a web browser, a mobile app, or a desktop application.
- Server: The server is a powerful computer or software application that processes requests from clients, manages resources, and delivers the requested services or data.
- Network: The communication medium that allows clients and servers to exchange data.

## How client server architecture works ?

The client-server model operates on a request-response mechanism, where clients send requests to the server, and the server responds with the requested information or service.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

- Client Request: The client sends a request to the server. This request could be for a webpage, a database query, a file download, or any other service the server offers.

- Request Processing: The server receives the request and processes it. This might involve retrieving data from a database, executing some business logic, or generating a dynamic response.

- Server Response: Once the server processes the request, it sends a response back to the client. The response typically contains the data or service the client requested.

- Client Processing: The client receives the response and processes it. For example, a web browser would render a webpage, or a mobile app might display the requested data to the user.
