# Software Architecture Patterns EVERY Developer Should Know

Software architecture patterns form the backbone of modern application development.

They guide how components are structured, interact, and evolve—helping your system stay flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain.

## Client-Server Architecture

The Client-Server model stands as one of the oldest and most fundamental architectural patterns in computing.

It separates a system into two distinct components: clients, which request services or resources, and servers, which fulfill those requests.

The client is responsible for presenting data to the end-user and collecting user input. In contrast, the server focuses on performing data processing, executing application logic, and managing data storage.

Clients and servers often interact over a network (e.g., the internet or a private intranet). This means that the server could be anywhere in the world, while the client might be a smartphone, a browser, or a desktop application.

## Layered Architecture

A layered architecture organizes your system into layers, each layer responsible for one major aspect of the application.
For instance, a simple three-layered design might include:

- Presentation Layer: Handles UI and user interactions.
- Business Layer: Manages application logic and domain rules.
- Data Layer: Interacts with databases or external services.

Each layer provides a set of services or functionalities to the layer above it. The presentation layer does not need to know how the data is stored—it just calls the business layer, which in turn interacts with the data layer.

These boundaries result is a design that encourages separation of concerns, testability, maintainability, and clarity of the codebase.

It’s a pattern you’ll find frequently in large enterprise applications and legacy systems, as well as modern distributed applications.

## Monolithic Architecture

Monolithic architecture is the traditional way of building applications as a single, unified codebase.

In a monolith, the entire application’s modules—UI, business logic, and data access—are developed, tested, and deployed together. This often means a single code repository, a single build pipeline, and a single deployment artifact.

Initially, a monolith is simple. But as your application grows, it becomes more challenging to maintain, scale, and deploy. A small change in one part may require re-deploying the entire application. This slows down development, testing, and release cycles.

## Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture break an application into small, independently deployable services. Each service focuses on a specific function—like user authentication, product catalogs, recommendation engines and communicates with others through lightweight protocols like HTTP or gRPC.

## Event-Driven Architecture

In event-driven architecture, components communicate through events. Producers publish events, and consumers react to them.

This creates a loosely coupled system that’s highly adaptable and responsive. This means you can update, replace, or scale individual components independently without changing the entire system.

Example: When a customer places an order, an “Order Created” event is published. Different services—inventory management, shipping, notifications—react accordingly. Inventory updates stock, shipping schedules a delivery, and notifications send the order confirmation email. These services work independently, all driven by the same initial event.
