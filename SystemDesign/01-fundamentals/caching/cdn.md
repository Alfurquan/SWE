# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Imagine you've built an app that serves video content to millions of users worldwide.

To keep things simple, you host all your videos in one geographical location.

At first, everything seems to work fineâ€”users located near the server enjoy smooth playback with minimal buffering.

But as your audience grows globally, you start noticing a problem.

Users in distant regions experience significant latency, slow load times, and frustrating buffering issues. The farther they are from your server, the longer it takes for data to travel across the network, degrading their experience.

To fix this, you need a way to bring your content physically closer to your users, reducing the distance data must travel.

This is exactly what a Content Delivery Network (CDN) does.

## What is a CDN?

A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver web content (like HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos) to users based on their geographic location.

When a user requests content from a website, the CDN redirects the request to the nearest server in its network, reducing latency and improving load times.
