# Materialized Views

A materialized view is a precomputed, stored query result that can be refreshed periodically to improve database performance.
Unlike regular views, which execute queries dynamically every time they are accessed, materialized views store query results physically, reducing computation time for complex queries.

## When Should You Consider Using Materialized Views?

- When queries involve expensive aggregations, such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, or complex joins.
- When real-time updates are not needed, and periodic refreshes are acceptable.
- When the same complex query is frequently executed, reducing CPU and memory usage.
- When reducing query latency is critical, such as in reporting dashboards.

**Materialized views are powerful for precomputing expensive queries, significantly improving read performance in analytical and reporting workloads. However, they require careful refresh strategies to balance performance and data freshness. If your database has frequent analytical queries that donâ€™t require real-time updates, materialized views can dramatically reduce query time and system load.**
