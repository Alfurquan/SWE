# Push vs Pull Architecture

## Push Architecture

In a push architecture, data or updates are sent from a central server or source to clients as soon as they become available.

The server initiates the communication, pushing information to clients without waiting for a specific request.

### Examples of push

- Notifications Systems: Mobile push notifications that alert users to new messages, updates, or events.
- Live Feeds: Real-time data feeds like stock market tickers or social media updates.
- Streaming Services: Video or music streaming platforms that push content to users.

## Pull Architecture

In a pull architecture, clients request data or updates from the server as needed.

The client initiates the communication, pulling information from the server when it requires specific data.

### Examples of pull

- Web Browsing: Browsers request web pages or resources from servers as needed.
- APIs: RESTful APIs where clients request data from a server.
- Database Queries: Applications querying a database to retrieve specific data.

## When to Use Each Approach ?

Choose Push Architecture When:

- Building real-time or near-real-time systems (e.g., live dashboards, instant messaging)
- Dealing with time-sensitive data (e.g., stock prices, emergency alerts)
- Working with sources that produce data at unpredictable intervals
- Bandwidth efficiency is crucial, and you want to avoid unnecessary data transfers

Choose Pull Architecture When:

- Building systems that can tolerate some delay in data updates
- Working with stable, predictable data sources
- Implementing systems where receivers need to control their data intake
- Dealing with unreliable network conditions where failed pushes could lead to data loss.
