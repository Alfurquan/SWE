# Monolith vs Microservices

## What is a Monolith?

A monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where an entire application is built as a single, unified unit. All components—such as the user interface, business logic, and data access—are tightly integrated and run as a single process.

**Example: A classic e-commerce website where the frontend, backend, and database interactions are all part of one integrated application.**

## What are Microservices?

Microservices Architecture is an approach where an application is broken down into a collection of small, autonomous services. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business function and communicates with other services through lightweight protocols like HTTP/REST or messaging systems.

**Example: An e-commerce system where separate services manage user authentication, product catalog, order processing, and payment processing.**
