# REST vs GraphQL

REST, a time-tested architectural style, structures APIs around fixed endpoints and HTTP methods, making it intuitive and widely adopted.

On the other hand, GraphQL, a newer query language developed by Facebook, takes a more flexible and efficient approach, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request.

## Which One Should You Pick?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer. REST remains a great choice for simple APIs, while GraphQL is powerful for complex applications with varying data needs.

Ultimately, it’s not about which is better, but which is better for your specific needs.

Here’s a quick guide:

Use REST if:

- Your API is simple and doesn’t require flexible queries.
- You need caching benefits from HTTP.
- You need a standardized, well-established API approach.
- You’re integrating with third-party services.
- Your team is already familiar with REST and need faster implementation.

Use GraphQL if:

- You need flexible and efficient data fetching.
- Your API serves multiple clients (mobile, web, IoT) with different data needs.
- Real-time updates are required (GraphQL subscriptions).
- You want to avoid API versioning issues.
- Your application requires deeply nested data

Can You Use Both REST and GraphQL?

Absolutely! REST and GraphQL are not mutually exclusive, and many organizations implement a hybrid approach to get the best of both worlds:

- GraphQL for client-facing applications where flexibility, performance, and dynamic querying are essential.
- REST for admin interfaces, third-party integrations, and internal microservices where statelessness, caching, and simplicity are beneficial.
