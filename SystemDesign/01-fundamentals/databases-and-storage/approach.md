Great question! Given your time constraints and the need to cover multiple topics for L5 interviews, here's an efficient approach:

ðŸŽ¯ Efficient Study Strategy
Phase 1: Quick Solidification (30-45 minutes)
Solve 2-3 targeted problems immediately:

Problem 1.1 (E-commerce Product Catalog) - Tests document + text search selection
Problem 2.1 (Gaming Leaderboard) - Tests in-memory + design considerations
Problem 3.1 (Content Management) - Tests multi-database architecture
Why these 3?

Cover 6+ database types
Test both selection logic AND design considerations
Representative of real interview scenarios
Phase 2: Move Forward (Focus on other topics)
Continue with your roadmap:

Caching strategies
Load balancing
Rate limiting
Message queues
etc.
Phase 3: Spaced Repetition Reviews
Week 1 Review (15 minutes):

Re-solve the same 3 problems quickly
Focus on: "Can I instantly recall WHY I chose each database?"
Week 2 Review (20 minutes):

Solve 2 NEW problems from the intermediate set
Compare your approach to Week 1
Pre-Interview Review (30 minutes):

Quick mental walkthrough of all 10 database types
Solve 1 advanced multi-database problem
ðŸš€ Time-Optimized Problem Selection
If you only have 30 minutes total, solve just these 2:

Mini-Problem A: Social Media Feed (8 minutes)
"Design storage for Instagram-like feed: posts, likes, followers, recommendations"

Tests: Document (posts), Graph (relationships), In-memory (feed cache)
Key insight: Multi-database thinking
Mini-Problem B: Real-time Analytics Dashboard (12 minutes)
"Store and query IoT sensor data: 50K sensors, real-time dashboards, 2-year historical analysis"

Tests: Time-series, Wide-column, In-memory
Key insight: When to choose time-series vs wide-column
Remaining 10 minutes: Mental review of when to use each database type

ðŸ“š Quick Reference Card (Create This!)
Make a 1-page cheat sheet:

ðŸŽª Interview Readiness Test
Before interviews, spend 5 minutes on this quick test: "Netflix needs to store: user profiles, movie metadata, viewing history, recommendations, video files, search functionality, real-time analytics"

Can you instantly map each requirement to a database type? If yes, you're ready!

âœ… Recommended Approach
Today: Solve 2-3 problems (45 minutes max)
Continue roadmap: Move to next topics
Weekly reviews: 15-20 minutes each
Pre-interview: Quick refresh
This approach gives you 80% of the benefit with 20% of the time investment. The key is that database selection becomes intuitive through pattern recognition, not exhaustive practice.

Would you like me to provide the streamlined versions of those 3 key problems to maximize your 45 minutes?
