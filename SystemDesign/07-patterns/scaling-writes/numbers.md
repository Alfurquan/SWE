# ðŸ§® Great Question! Here's How I Know That Number

The "Single DB Write Limit" Rule of Thumb
A typical single database server can handle approximately:

- 1,000-2,000 writes per second (depending on hardware and write complexity)
- 10,000+ reads per second (much higher because reads can be cached/optimized)

This is a fundamental system design number you should memorize!

Where These Numbers Come From:

Physical Constraints:

- Traditional HDD: ~200-300 writes/second (disk seeks are slow)
- Modern SSD: ~1,000-2,000 writes/second (much faster, but still limited)
- High-end NVMe SSD: ~5,000-10,000 writes/second (expensive, rare)

Database Overhead:

- Each write involves: validation, indexing, transaction logging, consistency checks
- MySQL/PostgreSQL: Typically 500-2,000 writes/second on good hardware
- Write-optimized DBs (Cassandra): 5,000-10,000+ writes/second

The Math That Led to My Conclusion:

Our calculated load: 3,400 writes/second
Typical single DB limit: 1,000-2,000 writes/second
Ratio: 3,400 Ã· 1,000 = 3.4x over capacity!

How You Learn These Numbers:

System Design "Magic Numbers" to Memorize:

Single database writes: ~1,000/second
Single database reads: ~10,000/second
Network round trip: ~100ms
Memory access: ~1ns
SSD read: ~100Î¼s

These are fundamental numbers that come up repeatedly in system design interviews and real-world architecture decisions. Memorizing them helps you quickly estimate system capabilities and design trade-offs.

Quick Sanity Check Framework:
When you see write numbers in a problem:

Calculate writes/second
Compare to ~1,000/second baseline
If > 1,000: You need scaling strategies
If > 10,000: You definitely need multiple approaches

Why This Matters for Interviews:
Interviewers expect you to know:

- Single machine limits exist
- When you've hit those limits
- That you need to scale horizontally beyond them

The magic number "1,000 writes/second" is your trigger to start talking about:

- Sharding
- Write-optimized databases
- Queues and batching
