# Advanced Topics

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures (1â€“2 weeks)

**Focus on algorithms you encountered but didnâ€™t implement:**

### Consensus Algorithms

- Raft consensus (for distributed coordination)  
- PBFT (Byzantine fault tolerance)  
**Practice:** Design a distributed configuration service  

### Advanced Data Structures

- Count-Min Sketch (approximate counting)  
- Bloom Filters (membership testing)  
- Consistent Hashing (load distribution)  
- Merkle Trees (data integrity)  

### Graph Algorithms for Scale

- Community Detection (social networks)  
- PageRank (ranking algorithms)  
- Graph Partitioning (distributed graphs)

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: Distributed Systems Deep Dive (2â€“3 weeks)

**Perfect! Your knowledge base is excellent. Based on what youâ€™ve already covered and your resources, hereâ€™s your strategic path:**

### Distributed Consensus Systems

- Raft Algorithm implementation (you have the theory, now practice)  
- ZooKeeper-like coordination service design  
- Byzantine Fault Tolerance for blockchain systems  

### Advanced Data Structures in Practice

- Count-Min Sketch (you encountered this in Top-K)  
- Bloom Filters for membership testing  
- Merkle Trees for distributed integrity  

### Distributed Database Internals

- Consistent Hashing (you have implementation, now apply to real systems)  
- Vector Clocks for ordering events  
- Gossip Protocols for information dissemination
