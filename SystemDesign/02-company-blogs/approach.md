## 🎯 How to Read Effectively (Avoid Overwhelm)

### Reading Strategy
1. **Pre-filter Articles**  
Look for these keywords in titles:  
✅ "Scaling [Technology]"  
✅ "Architecture of [System]"  
✅ "How We Built [Feature]"  
✅ "Database Migration"  
✅ "Lessons Learned"  

Avoid initially:  
❌ Deep technical implementations  
❌ Very specific technology tutorials  
❌ Research papers  
❌ Performance benchmarking details  

2. **Active Reading Method**  
#### Article: "Scaling Pinterest's Database"  
- **Problem:** What challenge were they solving?  
- **Solution:** What approach did they take?  
- **Trade-offs:** What did they sacrifice/gain?  
- **Takeaway:** What pattern can I apply elsewhere?  
- **Interview Relevance:** How might this come up in design questions?  

3. **Create Company Pattern Cards**  
#### Netflix Pattern: Microservices  
- **When:** When monolith becomes unwieldy  
- **How:** Service decomposition by business domain  
- **Challenges:** Service communication, data consistency  
- **Monitoring:** Distributed tracing, service mesh

## 💡 Pro Tips for L5 Preparation
1. **Focus on Architecture Decisions** – Don’t get lost in implementation details. Focus on *why* they chose specific solutions.  
2. **Note Common Patterns** – You’ll see the same patterns across companies:  
   - Database read replicas  
   - Cache-aside patterns  
   - Message queue decoupling  
   - Service mesh for microservices  
3. **Create Your Examples Bank**  
   - *Caching:* "Netflix uses EVCache for user personalization data"  
   - *Sharding:* "Pinterest shards by user ID for balanced load"  
   - *Queues:* "Uber uses Kafka for real-time location updates"  
4. **Map to Interview Questions** – Always think: "If asked to design a ride-sharing app, I can reference Uber's approach to X".
