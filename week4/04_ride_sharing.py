Week 4 - Mock Interview 4: Ride Sharing Service
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 90 minutes | Google L5 Full System Implementation

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design ride sharing platform backend (like Uber/Lyft)

CORE FEATURES:
- Real-time driver/rider matching
- Dynamic pricing algorithm
- Route optimization and navigation
- Payment processing
- Rating and review system
- Real-time location tracking

OPERATIONS:
- requestRide(rider_id, pickup, destination): Request ride
- acceptRide(driver_id, ride_id): Driver accepts ride
- updateLocation(user_id, lat, lng): Update GPS location
- calculateFare(distance, duration, surge): Calculate ride cost
- completeRide(ride_id, payment_info): Complete and pay
- rateRide(user_id, ride_id, rating): Rate experience

REQUIREMENTS:
- Real-time location updates (< 1 second)
- Efficient driver-rider matching
- Dynamic pricing based on demand
- Route optimization for multiple stops
- Handle millions of concurrent users
- Cross-platform mobile app support

SYSTEM COMPONENTS:
- Geospatial indexing (QuadTree/R-tree)
- Real-time messaging system
- Machine learning pricing model
- GPS tracking and mapping
- Payment gateway integration

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Uber backend, Lyft matching algorithms, DoorDash delivery, Google Maps integration

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- Handling GPS accuracy issues?
- Surge pricing fairness algorithms?
- Driver fraud detection?
- Multi-destination route optimization?
- International market adaptations?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
ride_service = RideSharingService()
ride_id = ride_service.requestRide("rider1", pickup_location, destination)
ride_service.acceptRide("driver1", ride_id)
ride_service.updateLocation("driver1", lat=37.7749, lng=-122.4194)
fare = ride_service.calculateFare(distance=5.2, duration=15, surge=1.5)
ride_service.completeRide(ride_id, payment_info)
ride_service.rateRide("rider1", ride_id, rating=5)
