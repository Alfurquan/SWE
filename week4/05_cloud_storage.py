Week 4 - Mock Interview 5: Cloud Storage Service
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 90 minutes | Google L5 Full System Implementation

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design cloud storage service (like Google Drive/Dropbox)

CORE FEATURES:
- File upload and download
- File synchronization across devices
- Sharing and collaboration
- Version control and history
- Real-time collaboration editing
- Storage quota management

OPERATIONS:
- uploadFile(user_id, file_data, path): Upload file to cloud
- downloadFile(user_id, file_id): Download file
- shareFile(owner_id, file_id, users, permissions): Share with others
- syncChanges(user_id, device_id): Sync across devices
- getFileVersions(file_id): Get version history
- collaborativeEdit(file_id, user_id, changes): Real-time editing

REQUIREMENTS:
- Handle files up to 5GB
- Real-time sync across devices
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
- Efficient storage and deduplication
- Strong access control and security
- Support offline mode with sync

SYSTEM COMPONENTS:
- Distributed file storage
- Content delivery network
- Real-time collaboration engine
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Metadata database
- Client synchronization protocol

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Google Drive backend, Dropbox sync, OneDrive collaboration, Box enterprise features

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- File deduplication strategies?
- Handling large file uploads?
- Conflict resolution in collaborative editing?
- Security and encryption at rest?
- Mobile app offline capabilities?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
cloud_storage = CloudStorageService()
file_id = cloud_storage.uploadFile("user1", file_data, "/documents/report.pdf")
file_data = cloud_storage.downloadFile("user1", file_id)
cloud_storage.shareFile("user1", file_id, ["user2"], ["read", "write"])
changes = cloud_storage.syncChanges("user1", "device123")
versions = cloud_storage.getFileVersions(file_id)
cloud_storage.collaborativeEdit(file_id, "user2", text_changes)
