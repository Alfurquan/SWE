EXPECTED INTERFACE:
trading_system = TradingSystem()
order_id = trading_system.placeOrder("trader1", "AAPL", 100, 150.50, "LIMIT")
trading_system.cancelOrder(order_id)
market_data = trading_system.getMarketData("AAPL")
portfolio = trading_system.updatePortfolio("trader1")
risk_check = trading_system.checkRiskLimits("trader1", order_data)
trading_system.generateAuditLog(transaction_data)
