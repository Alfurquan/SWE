Week 4 - Mock Interview 7: Gaming Platform Backend
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 90 minutes | Google L5 Full System Implementation

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design multiplayer gaming platform (like Steam/Discord Gaming)

CORE FEATURES:
- Real-time multiplayer game sessions
- Player matchmaking system
- Leaderboards and achievements
- In-game chat and voice
- Game state synchronization
- Anti-cheat detection

OPERATIONS:
- createGameSession(game_id, max_players): Create game room
- joinGame(player_id, session_id): Join game session
- updateGameState(session_id, state): Sync game state
- findMatch(player_id, skill_level): Find suitable match
- updateLeaderboard(game_id, player_scores): Update rankings
- detectCheating(player_id, actions): Anti-cheat monitoring

REQUIREMENTS:
- Real-time game state sync (< 50ms latency)
- Fair matchmaking based on skill
- Handle thousands of concurrent games
- Reliable game state persistence
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Scalable voice/video chat

SYSTEM COMPONENTS:
- Real-time game servers
- Matchmaking algorithms
- WebRTC for voice/video
- Game state databases
- Anti-cheat machine learning
- Global server infrastructure

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Steam multiplayer, Discord game integration, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- Handling network lag compensation?
- Skill-based matchmaking algorithms?
- Game state conflict resolution?
- Preventing distributed denial of service?
- Cross-region player matching?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
gaming_platform = GamingPlatform()
session_id = gaming_platform.createGameSession("fps_game", max_players=10)
gaming_platform.joinGame("player1", session_id)
gaming_platform.updateGameState(session_id, game_state_data)
match = gaming_platform.findMatch("player1", skill_level=1200)
gaming_platform.updateLeaderboard("fps_game", player_scores)
cheat_detected = gaming_platform.detectCheating("player1", recent_actions)
