Week 1 - Problem 4: Stack with Min Operation
Difficulty: Medium | Time Limit: 20 minutes | Google L5 Fundamental

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving minimum element in O(1)

OPERATIONS:
- push(x): Push element x onto stack
- pop(): Remove element on top of stack
- top(): Get top element
- getMin(): Retrieve minimum element in O(1)

REQUIREMENTS:
- All operations must be O(1) time complexity
- Handle empty stack edge cases
- Support duplicate minimum values

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Expression evaluation, function call stacks, undo operations with constraints

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to support getMax() as well?
- Memory optimization techniques?
- Thread safety for concurrent access?
- Implementing with limited memory?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
stack = MinStack()
stack.push(3)
stack.push(1)
stack.push(4)
print(stack.getMin())  # 1
stack.pop()
print(stack.getMin())  # 1
stack.pop()  
print(stack.getMin())  # 3
