Week 3 - Problem 10: Social Media Feed Algorithm
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 90 minutes | Google L5 Complex System Integration

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design social media feed ranking algorithm (like Facebook/Twitter)

OPERATIONS:
- addPost(user_id, content, timestamp): Create new post
- addInteraction(user_id, post_id, type): Track likes/comments/shares
- generateFeed(user_id, limit): Generate personalized feed
- updateUserInterests(user_id, interests): Update user profile
- getTrendingPosts(limit): Get globally trending content

REQUIREMENTS:
- Real-time feed generation (< 200ms)
- Personalization based on user behavior
- Trending content discovery
- Content freshness vs relevance balance
- Scalable to billions of users and posts

ALGORITHM:
Machine learning ranking, graph algorithms, real-time scoring

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Facebook News Feed, Twitter Timeline, Instagram Feed, LinkedIn Feed

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to handle viral content spikes?
- Content filtering and moderation?
- A/B testing feed algorithms?
- Cross-platform content synchronization?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
feed_algo = SocialFeedAlgorithm()
feed_algo.addPost("user1", "Hello world!", 1640995200)
feed_algo.addInteraction("user2", "post1", "like")
feed = feed_algo.generateFeed("user2", limit=20)
trending = feed_algo.getTrendingPosts(limit=10)
feed_algo.updateUserInterests("user2", ["technology", "sports"])
