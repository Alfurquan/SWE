Week 3 - Problem 6: A/B Testing Framework
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 80 minutes | Google L5 ML + Statistics

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Build A/B testing framework with statistical analysis

OPERATIONS:
- createExperiment(name, variants, traffic_split): Setup experiment
- assignUser(user_id, experiment): Assign user to variant
- logEvent(user_id, experiment, event_type, value): Track events
- getResults(experiment): Get statistical results
- stopExperiment(experiment, winner): End experiment

REQUIREMENTS:
- Statistical significance testing
- Multiple metric tracking
- Traffic splitting algorithms
- Bias detection and mitigation

ALGORITHM:
Statistical hypothesis testing, randomization, variance reduction

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Google Optimize, Facebook's Planout, Optimizely, growth engineering

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to handle multiple testing problem?
- Sequential testing and early stopping?
- Long-term effects measurement?
- Machine learning experiment optimization?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
ab_test = ABTestFramework()
ab_test.createExperiment("button_color", ["red", "blue"], [0.5, 0.5])
variant = ab_test.assignUser("user123", "button_color")
ab_test.logEvent("user123", "button_color", "click", 1)
results = ab_test.getResults("button_color")
