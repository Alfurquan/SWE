Week 3 - Problem 7: Load Balancer with Health Checks
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 75 minutes | Google L5 Network Systems

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design load balancer with intelligent routing and health monitoring

OPERATIONS:
- addServer(server_id, address, weight): Add backend server
- removeServer(server_id): Remove server from pool
- route(request): Route request to optimal server
- updateHealthStatus(server_id, status): Update server health
- getLoadDistribution(): Get current load statistics

REQUIREMENTS:
- Multiple load balancing algorithms (round-robin, weighted, least-connections)
- Health checking with circuit breaker pattern
- Session affinity support
- Dynamic weight adjustment

ALGORITHM:
Weighted round-robin, consistent hashing, health monitoring

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to handle server overload?
- Geographic load balancing?
- SSL termination handling?
- Integration with auto-scaling?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
lb = LoadBalancer(algorithm="weighted_round_robin")
lb.addServer("server1", "192.168.1.10", weight=3)
lb.addServer("server2", "192.168.1.11", weight=2)
server = lb.route(request)
lb.updateHealthStatus("server1", "unhealthy")
stats = lb.getLoadDistribution()
