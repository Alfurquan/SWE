Week 3 - Problem 3: Search Ranking System
Difficulty: Hard | Time Limit: 90 minutes | Google L5 ML + Algorithms

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Design search ranking system with relevance scoring

OPERATIONS:
- indexDocument(doc_id, content): Add document to index
- search(query, limit): Return ranked search results
- updateClickFeedback(query, doc_id): Learn from user clicks
- addFeature(feature_name, extractor): Add ranking feature
- trainModel(click_data): Update ranking model

REQUIREMENTS:
- TF-IDF scoring with modern improvements
- Machine learning ranking (Learning to Rank)
- Real-time click feedback integration
- Support for multiple ranking features

ALGORITHM:
Inverted index, TF-IDF, machine learning ranking models

REAL-WORLD CONTEXT:
Google Search, Elasticsearch, enterprise search systems

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- How to handle billions of documents?
- Real-time index updates?
- Personalized ranking?
- Handling different document types?

EXPECTED INTERFACE:
search_engine = SearchEngine()
search_engine.indexDocument("doc1", "machine learning algorithms")
search_engine.indexDocument("doc2", "deep learning neural networks")
results = search_engine.search("machine learning", limit=10)
search_engine.updateClickFeedback("machine learning", "doc1")
